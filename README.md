# Zcreator-Enhanced
This is an updated version of the Zcreator made by Nashira. Please refer to: https://github.com/juuussi/zCreator_data for update instruction for skills/spells/classes

This version updates the list of wishes to include all of current wishes available except for improved resistances
This version allows you to copy and paste skill/spell choices to train them more quickly or alternatively for
people who do not wish to allow access to their clipboard you can save your skill/spell choices to a .txt
document in the zcreator folder or anywhere else you choose and can copy/paste from there.

It will format skills and spells so they are ready to directly paste into the client and train/study with
the command stack key being semi-colon(;). To do this just build your character as normal then click copy
in the skills tab toward the bottom to copy your skills in a train format, or in spells to the same for
spells in a study format. The document saving option will combine skills and spells into one file so you
can copy and paste them all together if you wish.

This does not organize by guild/sub-guild so if you pick skills in healer and fight, then copy it will
copy all of the skills and have you paste them together, so if you wish to avoid this add skills and 
spells for the guilds you want to study/train at seperately I.E pick all fig skills you want and train
them before clearing and picking healer skills/spells
