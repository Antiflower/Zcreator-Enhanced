Help on skill:     Steady metabolism
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent

While the magic users of the realm can avoid the throes of close combat,
or deflect and repair any damage sustained, melee fighters do not enjoy
these luxuries. Those on the front lines of combat must prepare to take
their lumps, and learn to survive even while sustaining massive damage.
Experienced close-range combatants fare better at this, and can train
their bodies to self-heal during combat. The rate of recovery is seldom
comparable to regeneration in a resting state, but it reduces the need
for downtime in between fights.

Because they metabolize in other ways, this skill has no effect on members
on the death knight legion.

Help on skill:     Cavalier's charge
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, cavalier's charge, charge, mounted attack
                   and horsemanship

For a foot soldier nothing is as terrifying as a mounted knight approaching at
a full gallop, especially if the said knight is brandishing a polearm. While
such a charge is not the quickest of attacks, it is certainly devastating.
Knowledge of horsemanship is paramount for this type of an attack, for not
everyone can command their steed onto a headlong charge amidst awaiting enemies
and their weapons.
While this type of an attack relies mostly on brute force, some agility is still
necessary for the handling of the steed and the long weapon at full gallop.
This maneuver can be performed with any polearm, but it is the most effective
with those of the thrusting type. Heavier weapons are also more effective than
their lighter counterparts, due to the momentum provided by their greater weight.

Help on skill:     Eviscerate
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           very low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, dexterity and constitution

A basic, quick attack with a bladed weapon, mainly aimed at the center of mass,
favoured by the less skilled combatants. It is potentially very effective but
quite unreliable for the broad and often wild swings are predictable and easy to
block or avoid altogether.

This attack can be executed using either one or two weapons of type axe, sword,
polearm or bladed ancient. If either 'blood harvest' or 'gravesmite' is trained,
can also be used with a bludgeon or a bludgeoning ancient as the second weapon.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Ruinous utterance
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

While all death knights can wield destructive magics effectively, the
Nightweavers are among them the most adept. In their hands such spells may even
come to rival those of true sorcerous masters. But the most feared weapon in
their arsenal is the pure destructive power of the Shadow which the Nightweavers
wield with terrifying prowess.

Help on skill:  Rites of the grave
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

Much of the magic of the death knights tap into the essence of the undead or
death itself - such spells have been dubbed 'rites of the grave'. While these
spells may differ greatly from each other in purpose and complexity they all
share the same source. Through this general aptitude into wielding such power
is each individual spell, or a rite of the grave, improved.

Help on skill:     Deadslam
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill cost:        105 SPs
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, constitution and intelligence

The grave warden is a recognizable figure on the field of battle, wielding heavy
bludgeons that move with languid pace while each blow lands with seemingly
impossible force, enough to send shockwaves through the air. They achieve this
spectacular yet terrifying feat by augmenting their strikes with magic,
effectively adding more weight behind their weapons. With a delivery such as
this the use of already heavy weaponry can be of great benefit.

This attack can be executed using either one or two bludgeon-type weapons,
including bludgeoning ancients.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Fell insights
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The special brand of magic the death knights wield can be extremely taxing,
especially without proper training. It is also largely unaffected by the methods
of conventional magics. To this end the death knights have had to come up with
their own set of theories and teachings. These fell insights will help death
knights combat the magical strain of their dark spells.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Fell warding
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The death knights are far from adepts of defensive magics, and their methods and
temperament are rarely suited to such a passive approach but through considerable
training they can conjure at least adequate wards. 

Help on skill:  Unhallowed magic
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The magic of the death knights is very different from any other: they use
themselves as the source and the focus of their magic, channeling the deathless
within, making their spells seem much like natural abilities rather than
constructions of the arcane. To master these unhallowed magics one must first
grasp the fundamental, the theory of invocation.

Help on skill:     Gravesmite
Usage duration:    1 round
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, constitution and dexterity

The dread reaper who favours bludgeons is a terrifying warrior, not necessarily
for the devastation that his strikes cause but because he is the unrelenting
undead who delivers one blow after another with singular focus and an unnaturally
steady pace until either he or his opponent lies dead on the battlefield.

This attack can be executed using either one or two bludgeon-type weapons,
including bludgeoning ancients. If either 'eviscerate' or 'blood harvest' is
trained, it can also be used with a suitable blade wielded as the second weapon.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Grim resolve
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent and constitution

While all warriors have the potential for developing their willpower in order
to stand firm against the crippling effects of fear and confusion and other
such maladies that can lead to their demise, the death knights have a distinct
advantage over the common warrior: they are all already dead. As such this type
of training for them is not so much about will as it is about getting rid of any
vestiges of mortality and any lingering qualms.

Help on skill:     Vile totem
Usage duration:    1 round
Skill type:        neutral
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, intelligence, rites of the grave and
                   profanities

As a final act of desecration the corpse of an enemy is used to erect a vile
totem, wreathed in dark magic. Upon its completion this unholy monument will
release a surge of energy that will rejuvenate the totem's creator and all
undead beings in the vicinity as well as they creator's allies even if they
were living.
While the vile totem stands its presence will continue to demoralize all
weaker living beings.

Help on skill:     Blood harvest
Usage duration:    random

Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, dexterity, constitution and
                   eviscerate

While highly skilled in the use of bludgeons, the blades are the signature
weapons of the dread reapers. And they wield these weapons of war with single-
minded focus to a bloody harvest, an unyielding and uncaring culling of all
life. Their techniques may not seem like much but anyone having faced a dread
reaper can attest that what they lack in flair they more than make up with their
implacable efficiency.

This attack can be executed using either one or two weapons of type axe, sword,
polearm or bladed ancient. If either 'gravesmite' or 'deadslam' is trained, it
can also be used with a bludgeon or a bludgeoning ancient as the second weapon.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Profanities
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The death knights are the epitome of anti-life, the very existence of these
dark champions a desecration of all that lives, and their profane rituals a
mockery of that which is pure. Through these profanities they strike fear into
the hearts of their opponents, sap their morale or turn their dead against them.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Eldritch weave
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

Although not true masters of such esoteric arts the death knights make extensive
use of the Shadow, weaving this darkest of forces into the magics. But such an
amalgamation is volatile and nigh impossible to control without proper training.
Through the mastery of this "eldritch weaving" are all such spells made more
reliable.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Reaping stance
Usage duration:    random
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, constitution, strength and grim resolve

The dread reaper is effectively both the unstoppable force and the immovable
object, relying in battle on his astounding and terrifying ability to withstand
horrible injuries while slowly but relentlessly grinding all opposition into
dust.

By assuming the reaping stance, the undead begins the inexorable march towards
his doomed foes which ends only when either he or his enemies lie dead on the
ground. While thus single-mindedly focused on battle, the dread reaper cannot be
reasoned with or bargained with for he will not stop or withdraw, not even to
preserve his own existence.

The reaping can be begun passively, waiting for a target to present itself, or
actively by challenging an opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Ferment unlife
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent

The unliving essence that nourishes the armies of the undead ordinarily
enters a state of sentient stasis when its existence is threatened. As
a result, the undead do not naturally recover their unlife during the heat
of combat. The more advanced ranks of death knights have overcome this
limitation through memorization of necromantic mantras that cause the
unlife within to agitate and self-replicate. Though these mantras have
no effect when their unlife is regenerating normally, it enables
them to recover a limited portion of their unlife while fighting.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Adrenaline rush.
Usage duration: 2.
Mental Cost: 150 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
With this skill, a monk can take advantage of his mastery of his mind to
aid in combat. By using this skill, the monk summons control of his mental
abilities to force his glands to release a burst of adrenaline, which
rushes through his bloodstream and provides his muscles with extra power
and speed, greatly enhancing his combat abilities. Unfortunately, this
depletes the muscles'natural ability to cleanse themselves of toxins and
restore fuel, and the result is that after the adrenaline leaves the
monk's bloodstream, he is left weaker and sluggish for a time.

Help on skill: Advanced martial arts.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While even an inexperienced monk may be able to complete a great number of
martial arts techniques competently, there are several that can be mastered
only by someone of advanced training. These techniques may look overly
flashy and useless in practice to someone who is not familiar with them,
they are in fact just the opposite, highly specialized and necessary
techniques that make a truly experienced monk capable of doing vast
amounts of damage. This skill describes a monk's total knowledge of
advanced martial arts techniques.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ambidextrous attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill comes as a necessary part of a monk's training in unarmed
combat. Nearly all monks naturally favor one leg over the other, and
one arm over the other as well, when it comes to completing martial
arts techniques. This is clearly dangerous, since it often results in
the monk missing opportunities to strike at his opponent. To correct
this natural behavior, monks are taught to fight equally well with
both sides of their body, and to ignore their natural preferences,
and then to be able to strike at the opponent as often and well as
possible, taking advantage of all openings in the defense. This skill
describes that training.

Help on skill: Attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): dex and weapon.
This skill allows you to score successful hits in combat.
Attack is the most fundamental skill of the melee related
skills. Only after a successful attack it is possible to
score stuns, criticals, doublehits and other higher forms
of damaging your opponent. Attack skill alone does not make
you a warrior, but it serves as the basis for many of the
skills. Attack percent is also modified by your Parry
setting if you have proficiency in it.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Attend wounds.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: heal.
Too often the only bandages you have on the battlefield are your two
hands, and all too often the less brave spellcasters are nowhere to be
found. In situations like this, any good fighter needs to know the
principles of attending wounds without supplies or magic. What you can
do is not much, but sometimes the slightest attendance can make the
difference between life and death. Sometimes its enough to just care
for the wounded, without any actual healing.

Help on skill: Backslash hit.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Special.
A long time ago a group of minotaurs mastered combat to the perfection
and found new combatsequence for a ferocious offensive move, Backslash
Hit. This skill, with the help of the Combat Trance, a skilled warrior
can take advance of every possible opening in the combat, dealing out even
more lethal blows than any other warrior. This skill can be learned by
any race, but only minotaurs can take full advantage of this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Balance momentum.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon whirling mastery.
Excluding creatures of strictly inhuman strength, no one is able to keep a
bludgeon in motion with raw strength alone. Initial strikes can easily be
powered by muscle alone, but in any prolonged fight it is the momentum of
the bludgeon that does most of the work. In order to keep your bludgeon in
constant motion, it is critical to place your blows so that they hit the
armored or otherwise hard bits of your opponent. A blow to the gut can
prove most painful, but it all too often results in the loss of momentum
so that the fighter will have to force the maul to swing again. It is
possible to learn the finer points of whirling your cudgel to a point,
but the rest will come with the knowledge of organs required to balance your
blows so that maximum damage is inflicted with the minimal loss of momentum.
The fighters proficient in this skill and mauling can also estimate the
the amount of momentum their weapons currently have by simply typing:
'momentum'. Higher skill gives more accurate estimations.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bash.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str.
A shield-bash, however strong you might be, will probably prove non-
lethal unless the opponent in question is the size of a squirrel, but in
comparison to using your bare fists without any sort of martial arts
training, the weight of the shield can be a good advantage. Also, if
an opponent is prepared against a maneuver with your primary weapon, the
sudden bash from the other side may surprise him, possibly interrupting
his own actions.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battle hardness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Neutral.
There is a saying among the humans who soldier for a living;
'A seasoned soldier is a quilt of scars', which describes
the hardness of a creature that has been slashed, stabbed,
set on fire, impaled and tortured before he turned thirteen.
Professional men-at-arms such as these know exactly how badly
they have been hit, and quite often, precisely what caused
the damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Battle lore.

With that precision, Combat Trance is more effective.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battle tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The benefit of rough hand-to-hand training is learning how to anticipate the
movement and thoughts of your opponent. Having the determination and skill to
deliver the fatal blow at the precise moment of your opponent's error can cause
devastating amounts of damage. This, and knowing the value of discipline is
what makes men of arms superior leaders in comparison to the spellcasting
guilds; who, despite their wisdom lack the gift of making quick decisions.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battlecry.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
The purpose of a battlecry before an onslaught is two-fold. On the one
hand it helps you to raise your morale, while on the other hand it invokes
fear within the ranks of your enemies. Experienced fighters often begin their
combat with a bloodcurdling battlecry if they have the initiative. A well
performed battlecry combined with a bold attack can make anyone it is
targeted at freeze in terror, even if the actual damage done is quite low.
This skill can only be used in the beginning of combat.

Help on skill: Berserk.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
The Fighters' Guild has often suffered from the mockery of the guilds that
consider their techniques more delicate, and not the least because of the
art of berserking. What looks like mad, uncontrolled rage to outsiders, is
actually something you must practice over and over again to successfully
use to your best advantage. A berserking fighter is bolstered in several
ways if he controls it. The fighter's strength, bravery and pain tolerance
raise according to the level of his training, and contrary to what other
guilds like to think, they remain in full control of their actions. The art
of berserking at will is mastered through the ability to control the
body's functions by mere will alone. The origin of this way was lost
in the tides of time, but the native barbarian tribes of the realm are
often assumed to be the likely source. Several other skills are linked
to this technique, and to take full advantage of the barbarian tribes'
heritage, achieving a high level of mastery in all of them is recommended.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bravery.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore pain and horror of the battle
by becoming so enraged and fierce that any personal loss becomes trivial.
The technique of berserking gives some of these advantages alone, but all
fighters experience a large scale of emotions in any combat. The most
meaningful of those should be mastered with individual and targeted
exercises. Bravery teaches the berserker to control the terror and fear
that much larger or more numerous opponents may inflict upon him.
The conditioning, if properly learnt, is so strong that the berserker
might even be able to resist magical means of frightening him.
Note: Bravery works automatically in conjunction with Berserk.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Brawl.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
This skill is actually a combination of different talents that all
have to do with being proficient in using different weapons of the ancients
weapons class. These weapons can be roughly divided to four subcategories:
puncturing weapons, bladed weapons, whips and different bludgeons.
This skill teaches its master to effectively use all of these odd weapons
with such deadly force that a skilled brawler is a terror to any opponent.
The damage caused by this skill is based on your weapon, physical statistics
and skill knowledge in brawl and dirty blow.
NOTE: these ancient weapons differ so much from each other that the damage
 caused by them can vary greatly. Whips cause great pain whereas mauls
 tend to cause vast internal damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Ca reo
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Ca Reo is the elven word for Absence. Humans often take note of
the seemingly great presence of elves, the way they seem to
'belong' in their environment. This is because an elf experiences
life directly and presently, where humans waste much time worrying
over what has already happened and what is still to come. Because
elves exist so strongly in the present, their absence from other
states is just as great. After harvested to combatative use, this
trait makes the elvenkind profoundly hard to hurt, for not even a
greater god may hit you where you are not. This style of Loc Ecsuram
is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'ca reo' or 'absence' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Calm down.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: special.
A fighter who enrages himself to the point of berserking can prove to be
a very dangerous foe, not the least because of their near legendary
ability to ignore the pain they have suffered. There is no permanent
escape from the pain and the damage suffered though, so proper techniques
of calming down are required for the fighter to choose the moment he
becomes vulnerable.

Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex

With the help of this skill the warrior learns to launch a powerful polearm
based attack maneuver from the safety of his shield. Shield is so essential
part of the executing of this skill that it simply cannot be done without it.
Successful usage of this skill requires that the warrior has gained at least
some sort of knowledge about ranged tactics, but despite of results the speed
is always determined by the size of the weapon. It is also rumoured that
knowledge of skills battlecry and bash somehow aid the users of this skill.

Help on skill: Clot wounds.
Usage duration: Random.
Mental Cost: 50 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): level and skill percent.
The ability of a monk to use his mind to control his body is one of the
largest portions of the mental training experienced by a monk. One aspect
of this is the ability to mentally force the monk's blood to clot and scab,
effectively closing a small wound and providing a small amount of healing.
This takes more mental energy than would be expended by a true healer to
do the same healing with a spell, but nevertheless is very important for
a monk who fights without his friends to help him after the combat has
ended.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Combat sense
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

This skill teaches the warrior using a bludgeon and a shield combination

Help on skill: Composting.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.

slightly from this, as it is relaxing, rewarding work.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Conceal spellcasting.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Spellcasting itself is a really difficult and sophisticated art. However
only true masters trained in this skill may try to cast their spells with
such proficiency that no one is able to notice the casting.
You can use the skill to toggle concealing on / off.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Concentrated swing.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, con, race, doctrines, battle lore and skill percent.
Concentrated swing is propably the greatest combat manouver created by
Mi'otau warriors. It takes advantage of the best parts of the tools of
war and combines them into a cruel and devastating move. The trick with
this move is that it makes a great variety of combinations. This makes
countermoves against the skill troublesome, as the opponent never knows
what the outcome of the move will be.
This move greatly depends on weapons used, and to be effective it needs
two different types of weapons to be wielded. As stated earlier different
weapons have different effect to the outcome of this skill, and it is
battle dependant when a warrior gets an opportunity to land a hit. Thus
opponent will not know which of the two weapons lands a hit.
This skill requires the warrior to be in a focused state to be able to
follow and take advantage of the opponent's moves.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Concentration of harmony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill is checked every time you cast a spell requiring harmony.
It will decrease the randomness of the spell that is cast 
more towards your actual percent in the spell.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Confounding elegance.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, intelligence and charisma.
It is quite fascinating how the Magus Artiste have been able to develop
so effective methods for controlling their magics. Especially since none of
the Artiste really bother pondering why something works the way it does.
When a Magus Artiste alters any of their projectile spells, the spell
will most likely become more taxing, magically and sometimes physically.
But when these manipulations are done with more elegance, as if one was
performing a work of art, it was found that the additional drain on the
Artiste's magical energy is lessened. This strange approach has caused much
bewilderment especially among mages and sorcerers who seek to codify magic
and find the logic that governs its workings. It is truly confounding.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Conjure light.
Usage duration: 2.
Mental Cost: 20 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Similar to the ability of a monk to attract electrical energy to his
knuckles to aid in combat is the ability to attract a small amount of
this energy into a single point to serve as a light source, which will
follow the monk around. This is a simple skill for all but the most
inexperienced monks to use, requiring far less energy than that used
to electrify the knuckles, and less mental ability as well. Despite
that fact, this can be a very useful ability for a monk to have,
should he become lost in the dark and be of a race unable to see in it.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Consider.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill allows you to gain information about the target. The amount
and accuracy of the information depends on your skill percent. You can gain
information of the target's weapon class, hitpoints, armour class, strength,
spells, resistances, attacks and, if you get lucky, maybe even some special.
information. At the end you get an overall estimation of the target's
abilities.

Help on skill: Construct roost.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: building.
Bards, being jacks of all trades, aren't afraid to get their

It helps increase the duration of the spell.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Convert.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Clerics may attempt to not only swap the target's alignment, but to
try and preach to a target about the merits of worshipping her god.
With convert, a cleric does just that. She launches into a tirade
about the virtues of whatever god she has devoted her life to in an
attempt to confuse and scare the target into worshipping that god.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Combat trance.
Usage duration: 6.
Skill type: Special.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, con, battle lore, race and skill percent.
The minotaurs have focused on their weapons since the Incident and
through that focus became true masters in using them. Along that mastery
they have developed a certain rhythm which allows them to maintain their
pace in the heat of combat. That rhythm does not only keep their head clear
and mind observant, but helps them to see how the fight will develop.
Warriors under the combat trance are fearsome opponents, moving their
weapons with almost unnatural speed, strength and precision. It is recognized
that older and more experienced villagers of Mi'otau benefit more from
this trance.
For an outsider it almost seems that they can read the opponents mind, as
they are able to predict where the opponent is moving next, and be prepared
to take advantage of those movements.
This skill is a prerequisite for other combat moves designed by Mi'otaus
and because of the nature of this skill, the user cannot focus on the trance
while fighting being berserk.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Corpse skinning.
Usage duration: 15.
Skill type: neutral.

in their enemies' defence and to exploit them without mercy or hesitation.

Help on skill: Damage analysis.
Usage duration: automatic.

about how much damage the target is taking from 
an offensive spell.
It is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Damage direction.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon placement mastery.
Once the basics of the various techniques are learned, it becomes quite
apparent to any soldier that controlling the bashes so that the brain,
not the bludgeon, decides where the next hit will land is very challenging.
To efficiently place your attacks, first hand knowledge of the ways your
bludgeons behave whilst in motion is required. While some of these basics
can be taught, the rest will only come with practice.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Dancing blade.
Usage duration:    4.
Skill type:        attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex.

In the proficient hands sword is a lethal instrument that can proverbially
dance in the air. Reaching that goal is, however harder for a warrior
who uses a shield. This skill teaches the basic techniques, which are
needed on the way towards that level of proficiency, and as a bonus the
fighter will also learn how use his shield as a supportive offensive
tool on the side of his sword. In order to reach the full potential of
this skill the fighter needs to deepen his knowledge by training bash and
the counterpart of this skill, protected blade.
Note:Executing this skill is slightly faster with small sized weapons
than what it is with larger weapons.

Help on skill:     Deadly torrent
Usage duration:    random

Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, intelligence, attack, weapon skill, doublehit, whirlwind attack, slash, whirlwind slash, 7th attack, wild strike, anatomy and spot weakness

A more advanced martial technique of the spellblades, consisting of a series
of rapidly executed strikes against a single opponent. While the individual
strikes are usually far from spectacular, the overwhelming barrage can easily
throw even a well-trained opponent off-guard and off-balance. And as an added
threat this attack is typically heavily augmented with magic, making it nearly
a match for the techniques of martial masters.
This attack can only be executed with daggers, swords, polearms, or bladed or
piercing ancients.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Decisive blows.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
This bludgeon technique is one of the finer aspects of mauling. A skilled
mauler has adapted to the behavior of his weapons to the point that he can
quickly estimate where they will be within the next few seconds, thus he is
able to consider and place his attacks intelligently instead of simply
bashing when opportunity arises. When performed by a master, this technique
inflicts injuries that can easily prove fatal for a mediocre opponent.
The downside is that the maces need to be controlled very precisely, often
in the expense of momentum and raw power.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dedicate spell.
Usage duration: 8.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill is used to invest a spell in a Millennium Wand or
Millennium Staff. Only spells known by the Druid may be dedicated
and the Druid's knowledge of the spell plays a part in the success
of the dedication.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Defend.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
Sometimes when your opponent proves to be extremely fiercesome in
hand-to-hand combat, it is strategically wise to concentrate on
defending yourself and let the other members of your warparty
deal the actual damage. A defending fighter uses his shield to
its full effect, placing it infront of his body and lowering down
to hide as much of himself behind it as possible. This tactic
is very effective against all forms of physical damage that the
shield can stop. The downside however, is that a berserking fighter
will utterly refuse to hide behind any object, and you need a shield
to perform this action. The quality and duration of the defense depends
on your skill percentage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dirty blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Brawling with different weapons of the ancient weapons class is a technique
favored by many of the Fighters' guild. The range of different ancients is
quite wide, even though most agree on the best weapon of that sort.
A brawling fighter skilled in dirty blow is able to occasionally augment
the blows by playing them less than fairly. Exposed areas with nerve
concentrations, the groin, the eyes and other vulnerable parts of the body
are the common targets of these less than fair attacks. The shock of the
assault can often cause stun in the opponent, and it also augments the
damage inflicted. This skill works in conjunction with Brawl, and the
higher the level of knowledge in dirty blow, the more often these
special. attacks will appear. All is fair in love and war, and we only
have enough time in our lives to properly do one of those two.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Doctrine of the ancient.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Special.
The weapon itself does nothing without the real knowledge how it
should be used. While every weapon differs in size and shape, there
is even more to be known than that.
Mi'otau warriors have finessed their knowledge of the weapons to
the perfection and this doctrine will help to achieve that knowledge.
With this skill Concentrated swing will be most effective when
right weapon is used.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dodge.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: defensive.
The master of this skill is able to dodge, and thus avoid, hits in combat.
Animals and other creatures can be naturally gifted in avoiding hits by
dodging, but for humanoids who wish to avoid quick blows while carrying
weaponry and armour, training is required. High dexterity makes avoiding
blows easier, and so does the lack of encumberance. Dodge and Parry
work best if used together, but even alone Dodge can prove extremely
helpful for an adventurer who lives a life of risks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Double maul.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Anyone who has battled against an opponent with weapons designed for bashing
knows that a hard impact from a bludgeon, even if it doesn't stun you, can
easily cause disorientation for a short moment. This technique of battling
with bludgeons takes advantage of that effect. The mauler delivers the initial
blow from the secondary weapon with the hope of creating distraction, and
then proceeds to perform a deadlier bash with his stronger arm.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Doublehit.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Almost all types of warriors and rogues possess the training required to
execute a doublehit. Doublehit allows those trained in it to follow-up
their initial attacks with a second hit from both weapons if two
are wielded. The higher the knowledge in Doublehit, the more often
an additional attack will occur.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Eerie fixation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill perfect and dexterity.
A talented Magus Artiste is able to control the magical projectiles of
their spells far beyond the capabilities of a more traditional magician.
Not only is this control possible during the creation of the projectile
but also in flight, provided that the Artiste has received proper training.
Having knowledge of the methods of 'eerie fixation' will potentially allow
the Artiste to counter the maneuvering of an elusive target. This is rather
taxing however, increasing the magical drain of a spell, and will not always
be successful as the alteration of a projectile's course is not a precise
art and also demands for very quick reflexes.

Help on skill: Enhance features.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This skill allows you to mold the targets features
so that they are more pleasing to the eye. It can
be quite painful to the target, so make sure they
are not ill of heart. It will be more difficult to 
enhance an already beautiful person's features.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Enhanced riposte.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
This skill deepens its master's knowledge in riposting, enhancing the
damage done with each riposte. The damage inflicted with a single
riposte is hardly ever sufficient to kill without prior damage,
but at a close fight even the smallest advantage can tip the scale.
How much the damage is enhanced depends on the level of the skill
percent and strength.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Epitaph.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Bards are nothing if not sticklers for records events as

in this skill will yield longer durations for such spells.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Fast blow.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Sometimes striking quickly at your opponent is more important than executing
a long and difficult technique, such as when an opponent is very nearly
dead, or attempting to flee. For these situations, a fast and simple
technique utilizing the superior speed of the hands is appropriate. This
skill describes such a fast, simple technique used by the monk with his
hands to quickly deal a small, but not insignificant, amount of damage.
Because of this simplicity, even an inexperienced monk can often execute
it quite well, and the advantages of strength and speed that come with
experience make it occasionally useful even to much more experienced ones.

Help on skill:     Fleeting auguries
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): intelligence, psionicist levels and art of telepathy

Despite the grandiose name this skill does not give the spellblade glimpses of the future. This talent originates from the psionicists who first joined the ranks of the spellblades, and relies on basic telepathics. During combat,the spellblade is able instinctively scan the surface thoughts of the opponent. This brief insight not only helps the spellblade dodge and parry
the opponent's attacks, but also improve his chances of tumbling any skills and spells the opponent may attempt and sometimes, a talented spellblade may even know beforehand what that skill or spell is.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Flip kick.

Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, boot quality and acrobatics skills.
With this skill, the bard demostrates her versitility by
flipping in the air several times and delivering a boot
to the head on her opponent. The quality of the boots
and the bard's strength and acrobatics skills play a large
part in the amount of damage done, while her dexterity and
combat skills allow for a chance to stun or interrupt
her opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Focus ki.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While the Ki skill allows a monk to concentrate his energy on producing
a loud shout combined with a single powerful attack designed to stun an
enemy, knowledge of the technique of Ki alone is often insufficient to
accomplish that goal. To enhance the Ki skill, and as part of the mastery
of a monk's body, he will learn to focus all of his energy into that shout
and strike, and will greatly increase both the damage done and the intensity
of the stun delivered.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Focus kungfu attacks.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While Kungfu may be considered the pinnacle of the training of a monk's
mastery over his body, a Kungfu which strikes critically at the enemy's
most undefended parts must be considered the pinnacle of its execution.
To accomplish this feat, the monk must be able to focus his entire body
into the execution of the Kungfu attack, relaxing and ignoring all else
for a brief moment. When this is accomplished, the Kungfu that results
will do significantly more damage to the enemy. This skill represents
a monk's ability to focus his Kungfu attacks in this manner.

Talisman was forged and awakened. Note that only the Druid that
Awakens the Talisman can take advantage of its full power. Other
Druids, and Bards, can take good advantage of the Talisman, with

Help on skill: Greater vulnerability.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wisdom.
Vulnerabilities are a perversion of the elemental shielding magic 
abjurers use actively. They are fundamental when dealing with 
resistant and tough enemies; The realm of Zombiemud is chock full 
of creatures that have developed impressive resistances against 
damage. Fortunately the School of Abjuration is equally impressive 
in their ability to breach these resistances. The vulnerabilities 
are an advanced form of magic that require much time to master, 
but are well worth the time put into them. This skill and the 
spell percents respectively will affect the outcome. 
It is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Grounding.

Wand or Staff. This is especially useful if the charging
process should fail.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Hammer.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Bludgeons are weapons that require little knowledge to use for moderate
results, yet those who choose to specialize in armed combat with mauls are
reluctant to say that any-a-man is a professional at birth if he only has
the strength to move a maul. Strength alone helps, but without the proper
techniques anyone would tire quickly in the heat of combat. This skill
covers the most basic of bludgeon techniques, how to hammer your opponents
without tiring yourself the first few seconds.

A monk who has trained extensively can combine his masteries over both his
body and mind, and cause himself to relax completely, redirecting all
energy towards the healing of the body and regeneration of mental energy.
While knowledge of this skill is available to all experienced monks,
those who take the time to truly master it through training of 'Mastery
of Healing Trance,' as part of their study of mastery of the mind will
experience noticably better results. Naturally, it is not possible for
the monk to achieve the concentration necessary for this skill while
fighting.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Hear noises.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.
It is hardly needed to say that in order to survive a battle you must

direction. This skill teaches you not only to let yourself calm down and
listen, but to direct your attention to a specific direction as well.

his mount. This skill contributes to the effectiveness of
mounted attack, mounted parry, mounted riposte, and mounted
combat.
NOTE: Controlling a mount is a rigorous activity, demanding
concentration. The dodge skill makes it very difficult to
maintain one's concentration and can spook the mount, reducing
the rider's overall level of control.

Help on skill: Hurl axes.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): various.
This powerful attack maneuver is the culmination of ranger's knowledge
in the axe weapons. With this skill, rangers of the deep forest can
hurl their axes at their enemies with lethal force, and actually have
the axes returned to them. This is only possible with the aid of a
magical enchantment, a spell called with the name 'balance axe' by its
inventor - a ranger, who got frustrated on losing his weapons to
enemies who survived his attack and fled with the axes.
The effectivess of this skill depends on the strength, dexterity and
ambidexterity of the ranger, relative size of the target, quality of the
weapons, as well as user's knowledge in axe fighting style, treecutting,
weapon skill, leftwield, axe mastery, spot weakness and bladed fury.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ignore pain.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
This technique allows the berserking fighter to ignore a larger portion of
the damage inflicted upon him. This means that the berserking fighter is
able to carry on fighting for much longer than he would be without this
ability. The damage will be felt later on, and that is when the lessons
in dealing with system shock and calming down come into question. Ignore
pain works in conjunction with Berserk.

Help on skill: Inner strength.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
This skill represents the battle-hardiness of most types of warriors.

Help on skill: Juggling.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
Through use of this skill, a bard is able to juggle several
specially summoned objects to entertain and please his
audience.  One of the major effects a juggling bard enjoys
is the ability to dodge several incoming area attacks, or at
least a portion thereof.  Another thing the bard may do is
to use the skill 'toss' to throw objects at his enemy with
great force.  The enemy, so distracted with watching the
bard juggle, is usually caught completely offguard.

Help on skill:     Keen strikes
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): intelligence

By and large the spellblades hail from the ranks of spellcasters, be they mages, psionicists or sorcerers. While their magical talents may differ, they all share a desire to meld their magic with steel. Being originally primarily
spellcasters who shun melee combat, the first step in their goal was to bolster their presence in melee. To this end a rigorous training regime was devised, which sought to capitalize on the spellcaster's sharp mind and magic, augmenting his skills in all aspects of melee.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ki.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Often it is not wise to start a battle against an opponent who is fully
capable of defending itself. To give a monk an extra edge against a tough
enemy, he will often start the battle with a single attack combined with
a battle shout. This has the effect of startling and suprising the enemy,
while at the same time inflicting some damage. If correctly executed, this
technique will leave the target stunned and unable to fight back, so that
the monk and his party are able to inflict further damage without fear
for their own health. Also, by continuing his training, a monk who studies
the ability to focus this attack may be able to strike a second blow to the
enemy, dealing more damage and stunning them yet again.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Kick.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Kicking is one of the most basic forms of attack, but that does not
mean it could be performed correctly without any practice. Other guilds,
especially the ones interested in magic, would probably find it amusing
that some spend time practicing how to extend their leg properly.
However, a properly placed kick can actually prove just as nasty as some
of the minor Offensive. spells. A fighter who wars and lives is a fighter
who knows the value of basic training.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Kiru
Usage duration:    2 rounds
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, kiru, zhinakoku, hiding, weapon mastery
                   and weapon stats

Kiru is a blade fighting technique in which the Samurai Warrior invests
all his physical strength and dexterity to perform a stunning attack on
his enemy. The bladed attacks of 'Kiru' were originally designed to
inflict terror and pain to the Samurai's opponent. However, when
employed by one of the most legendary of the Samurais, the sudden death
of the Samurai's opponent also becomes a very real possibility.

The Samurai's inner spirit affects his ability to follow-up his initial
kiru attack with secondary and tertiary attack maneuvers.

When wielding the Tebukuro-ken with inner spirit active, a successful
kiru may channel battle spirit into regenerative energy, mending wounds
through meridian flow. This requires knowledge of the shizen spell.

Should the stunning strike fail against a resilient opponent, advanced
tessenjutsu mastery may awaken reflexively, allowing the warrior's body
to flow like wind through leaves, achieving a state of formless defense.

The Samurai Artists are able to perform the stronger and more exhaustive
version of the Kiru attack developed by the legendary Samurai Artist,
Shogun Naganoro.

Syntax: use kiru at <target> <strong>.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Kungfu.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
Monks train in a number of powerful single attacks, which are much stronger
and more deadly than the normal routine of blows delivered in the course of
combat. The techniques together are called 'Kungfu', and form the most
important part of the combat skills of the monk. With this skill the monk
is able to make use of all of his amassed knowledge in the field of the
martial arts to strike his opponent. Because of this nature of Kungfu,
it is necessary to have knowledge in the simpler techniques to be able
to realize the full potential of the skill. Specifically, knowledge in
'fast blow', 'power kick', and 'mastery of kungfu' will increase the
damage done. Also, it is known that knowledge of 'focus kungfu attacks'
can allow the monk to strike critically with kungfu, and that knowledge
in the martial arts will increase the damage as well.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Leadership.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Able leadership has always been the key ingredient in the mid of a successful
party. This skill will not only train you how to successfully lead and command
a party of people but it will also teach you with the principles of combat. A
potent leader trained thus is able to position his troops so that it becomes
possible to hit the enemy in his weakest point of defence. This skill affects
both your ability to lead, and being led in parties.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Leftwield.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Knowledge in this skill allows you to perform attacks with a weapon
in your left hand. It is possible to score up to three hits with your
left-wielded weapon if you are successful in the initial hit, doublehit
and the whirlwind attack. You are able to wield the weapon of your choice
in your left hand by typing: 'lwield <weapon name>'.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Legendary conjury.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill perfect, intelligence and dexterity.
The Magus Artiste are oft-times derided by the so-called professional
magic-users for their very narrow focus and their tendency to just "wing it"
when it comes to magic. There is no doubt however that a truly talented
Magus Artiste is able to perform incredible feats when it comes to wielding
projectile magics. Even if they themselves do not know how exactly it all
works.
A Magus Artiste performing 'legendary conjury' essentially compresses
a magical projectile by channeling a great amount of energy into and around
it. This will make the conjuration of the projectile take a little more time but
will make it more stable and easier to control, allowing the Artiste to aim
it with incredible accuracy. Depending on the Artiste's proficiency and natural
hand-eye coordination, a spell conjured in this manner can cause severe,
critical injuries--potentially causing havoc only dreamed of by the traditional
spellcasters. Such manipulation will however make the projectile less
devastating should the Artiste's aim be off.
Possessing knowledge of the opponent's anatomy will surely aid in aiming
the projectile into the most vital parts. A keen mind that is always on the
lookout for weaknesses in an opponent's defenses has also been found to
make a difference.
While the casting of projectile magics comes naturally to the Magus Artiste,
most have stated that it is even easier while performing the 'legendary conjury'.

Help on skill:     Loc ecsuram
Usage duration:    random
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, skill knowledge and magus
Loc Ecsuram is the elven art of staff combat practiced by the
most skilled of elves from the dawn of the history of the race.
It is a form of combat performed by a single weapon wielded in
both hands, and more a matter of the mind than the body.
The Loc Ecsuram is in many way closest of all the elvish ways to the
Brotherhood of the Monks. Both rely on unlocking the inner power
of the combatant as well as turning the force of the opponent to
serve against themselves. Both consist of elements more profound
than simple martial arts. Furthermore, just like the art of
Kungfu, Loc Ecsuram can not be wholly learned by training alone.
Only after a life's experience of the Loc can the styles first
learned in the training grounds truly be perfected.
Once in the proper state of mind, the elf armed with a staff,
Loc in their language, will remain constantly alert to dangers,
and react should combat be initiated. This style of combat is as
much part of the elvish way of living for those elves who practice
it as the nature around them. It requires no effort to stay vigilant.
Certain parts of the Loc ecsuram can be performed without an opponent
present. This is because while Loc Ecsuram is a single unified way, it
contains several very different elements. Some, once learned, remain
always effective whenever in the proper state of mind while others
require conscious effort to perform. This skill teaches its practioner
the basics of combat with a Loc and allows him to use it to adopt the
proper state of mind required for other elements of the Loc Ecsuram.

Skill type: special.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Magus
Usage duration:    1 round
Skill type:        Loc Ecsuram
Affecting stat(s): wisdom, intelligence, constitution and magus

Magus is the elven word for Magic. The force which exists in all
things and beings. Perhaps the most powerful, fundamental force
in the universe, Magus empowers you to overcome your limitations,
drawing upon the power of life.

With this skill an elf trained in the Loc Ecsuram can draw upon
magic, compensating for his physical abilities. The magic will
be woven into every attack he performs, until its power is finally
consumed. This natural way of tapping magical potential truly does
compensate for the lack of physical prowess.

The more wise the elf, the more power he can contain at once, and
and more Magus is conveyed in each transition.  The effect of
intelligence is similar, but muted.

The Magus directed in this manner truly becomes a part of its user,
to the point that those susceptible to it can even see an aura
enveloping him.

This style of Loc Ecsuram is complicated and requires specific
concentration. You may use this skill while focused in Loc Ecsuram
and 'look at yourself' or 'the aura' at any time to see your current
aura of power.

This ability is stackable.

Help on skill:     Mangle.
Usage duration:    random.
Skill type:        attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex.

With this skill the warrior is able to combine the benefits of using a shield
and a weapon of ancient class. Due to the complicated nature of ancient weapon
class the warrior is taught to perform the special attack with all the weapon
types of ancient's subcategories. This attack is of course heavily tied to
a shield. It cannot be executed without it. The damage of this skill depends
from user's attributes and somewhat of his knowledge of trained eye and bash.
It is also noteworthy that the speed of this skill depends heavily from the size
of the used weapon.

Help on skill: Martial arts.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The basis of every monk's training is a number of techniques used primarily
in melee combat. These techniques, when considered together, are trained
by the monk as 'martial arts'. This covers all of these, as well as the
more fundamental aspects of fighting with the hands and feet rather than
with some weapon. This general knowledge of the martial arts is important
to every monk, regardless of his level of experience, and it is known to
affect the monk's ability to do damage with his Kungfu attacks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Master tumbler.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
One skill practiced by many monks is that of tumbling to avoid some spells.
This is accomplished through careful study of the physical paths traveled
by those spells towards the monk, as well as of the movements necessary to
leave that path as quickly as possible. It is not an easy task to tumble
and avoid an incoming spell, made more difficult by the speed of the spell
and the sometimes unnatural position the monk is left in in the middle of
a fight. However, those who study exceptionally hard at mastering their
bodies and the techniques of tumbling are known to have a significant
advantage in this act. This skill describes that advanced knowledge in
the area of tumbling.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mastery of healing trance.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Though the use of a simple healing trance can be learned, even to a high
level of proficiency, by most monks, it is not correct to think that it
is a simple skill. Through training the mind in some of the finer points
of this technique, the monk is able to achieve a more potent trance, and
will heal faster while in it.

Help on skill: Mastery of kungfu.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The skill Kungfu relies on knowledge of several simpler techniques.
However, this does not mean that these techniques are sufficient to
execute the Kungfu in the most powerful way. In fact, the more
difficult parts of the knowledge of Kungfu are numerous and important
enough that a monk must train himself in them separately. This skill
encompasses the knowledge learned by a monk to complete his training
in the techniques that are together known as Kungfu. This knowledge
will allow the monk to more accurately aim and time his Kungfus,
increasing the damage done.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mutilation.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: Offensive.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex and con.
Mutilation is a general term for a group of skills that all have to do
with proficiency in the bludgeons weapon class. In order to successfully
mutilate a designated target, you must learn the different bludgeon
techniques that this skill takes advantage of.'Hammer' is the most important
one because all further studies base on the principles of hammering an enemy.
After you've chosen the target for the mutilating assault, the finer points
of different techniques come into play. Different techniques fit different
purposes and moments, and therefore it is important to know which technique
to rely on in a given situation. You control your offense by typing the name
of the technique you wish to employ when you are engaged in combat. Should
you not find a suitable opportunity for an advanced technique, or lack
knowledge in them, your attacks will consist of the basic, hammering blows.
Skill knowledge of the techniques used, knowledge in damage direction,
balancing of momentum, and the statistics of your person and your weapon all
affect the outcome of the battle. Outwit your opponent, and fear no man.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mystifying flourish.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity and charisma.
The Magus Artiste have a lot in common with jesters and jugglers, more
so than they have with mages for example. There is a decidedly artistic
element present in all the magics of the Artiste, and for some reason it
also appears to be of great benefit.
When performing 'mystifying flourish' the Magus Artiste adds fancy gestures
and steps, even dance-like routines, to his spellcasting. Either this
prancing about truly does make the spells stronger or the on-lookers are
just so bewildered by it, that they are caught completely unawares by the
destructive projectiles. Either way, the agility and the charisma of the
Magus Artiste will now play a greater role in the effectiveness of the spells.
While a spell magnified in this manner does not drain additional magical
energy, the flourishing is slightly fatiguing in the long run. In most
cases the magical drain have actually been found to be lessened, suggesting
that there actually might be something real in these strange methods--
some wonder that essentially allows a Magus Artiste to convert physical energy,
stamina, into magical energy to fuel their spells.
A Magus Artiste who is especially talented and charismatic is often
able to hide the initiated spellcasting, though not by concealing it like
the psionicists do but rather disguising it with artistic embellishments
into something entirely harmless.

Help on skill: Overhead swing.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Often considered mere bashing by the users of more 'civilized' weapons, this
bludgeon technique seems easier to perform than it really is. The ability to
judge the right moment to open up your defense by raising your weapon far
above your head is something that only comes with practice. This form of
an attack is suitable for occasions when the opponent is either just raising
his defenses or is guarding his upper torso badly. Should the powerful bash
hit the head of the opponent, a single strike could prove lethal.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Parry.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: defensive.
The master of this skill is able to parry, and thus avoid, hits in combat.
Experienced fighters and paladins are often able to follow up their parry
with a riposte if they so choose. Parrying and dodging are the two most basic
means of avoiding damage in hand-to-hand combat, and most fighter type guilds
are proficient in either one or both of them. Dodge and parry together form
the defensive. value that is displayed when you toggle your parry setting.
This value is also affected by the weight you are carrying. It is to be
noted however, that when concentrating on parrying hits, your ability to
perform attacks of your own drops. It is possible to alternate the amount
of concentration towards parrying by typing: 'parry <0-51>'.
this will directly reflect to the values of both your Attack and
Parry skill. Parrying is more efficient with a shield.

Help on skill: Pinpoint aim.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity and intelligence.
The offense of a Magus Artiste almost solely relies on deadly accuracy,
rather than massive discharges of energy. In the hands of a talented Artiste
this approach is both devastating and economical. Such precision would not
be worth much, however, if one could not adapt. This is where the practices
of 'pinpoint aim' come into play. By taking a little more time in conjuring
the magic, a trained Magus Artiste is able to concentrate the projectiles
more accurately and with an intent that suits the current situation better--
be it a need to cause more devastating injuries, or to dazzle or to stun the
opponent.

Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Pon Arila is the elven word for Perception. A profound awareness
of your surroundings and changes. Elendien are by their nature
connected to the world with deeper ties than most other creatures.
Their long life and profound affection for the nature cause them
to experience the state of the world in persona. While this ability
is the natural way of any elf, harvesting its power in combat
requires an adjustment in thinking, which this skill represents.
After such an adjustment is made, the trainee becomes aware of his
surroundings to a point nearing precognition of events. The defensive
capabilities this bestows are very significant. Due to the nature of
this style it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is
performed.

Pon Deila means Harmony and Continuity in nature in the elven tongue.
In elven staff fighting it significes a method of combat taught
to grace the movements of an elf with a natural rythm. This makes
the transition from an offensive movement to an other faster and allows
for more powerful blows upon occasion if the practioner of Loc Ecsuram.
manages to move in perfect harmony with his Loc. Due to the nature of
this style it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is performed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Power kick.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
When a young monk is first learning to fight with his hands and feet, it is
natural to learn the simpler, faster blows delivered with the hands first.
However, the monks do not neglect the increased power that can be delivered
using the larger muscles of the legs and stronger surfaces of the feet. By
taking advantage of this and making a powerful kick at the enemy, even a
young monk is capable of dealing significant damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Pra evaleo
Usage duration:    2 rounds
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, weapon familiarity, pon deila, skill
                   knowledge, volo and magus

Pra Evaleo is the elven word for Power. The staff fighting style
designed to subdue the opponent was named after it. These attacks
are performed simultaneously with those of Volo but due to the strain
their performance causes, and the opportunities they require to succeed,
appear more infrequently. In the art of Loc Ecsuram, the Volo is used to
injure and distract the opponent until a suitable opportunity presents
itself, which is then pressed with Pra Evaleo.

For a well-prepared Tur-Loc Maethor, the moment Pra Evaleo batters an
enemy presents a second opportunity -- the opportunity to draw upon an
Aura of Magus. This withdrawal is deliberate, designed to enhance the
elemental properties of the ensuing strike.

By investing numerous human lifetimes becoming one with their Loc, the
Elf is better able to realize the Pra Evaleo.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prayer.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: heal.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill will revive a dead player, it has
the same effects as praying in the church.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prepare corpse.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and undead surgery.
When an advanced necromancer, one acquainted with the latest developments
in the field of scientific necromancy, wishes to create an undead, this skill
will be necessary. Traditional undead only require a corpse for reanimation,
but undead creatures animated with the scientific method, such as the
Frankenstein, require custom bodyparts. Upon successful use, this skill will
produce enough raw material for the creation of one such bodypart.
The efficiency of this skill is based on knowledge of this skill and
knowledge of the skill 'undead surgery'.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prepare potion.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill allows you to prepare an empty potion.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Prev enire
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Prev Enire is the elven word for Reaction. In staff fighting, it
signifies the way of matching the move of your opponent with an
equal one of your own, timed seamlessly to fit that of your foe.
An attack aimed to kill often leaves its performer prone to an
instant counter-attack, because its performer does not expect the
other to be alive to make one. Coupled with Pon Arila this gives
an elf trained with the Loc the means to strike back while bracing
to accept the incoming attack. This style of Loc Ecsuram is
complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'prev enire' or 'reaction' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Protected blade.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type:     special.

This skill finishes the training the fighter started by training dancing
blade. Alone both of these skills offer only partial knowledge and
a warrior without either of these skills is incomplete. Knowledge in this
skill adds to the knowledge of basics techniques, honing those towards
perfection. With the full knowledge of this skill and the basic techniques
the fighter's sword may truly dance.

This skill is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rage.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
One of the key lessons in berserking is the way a fighter can use his
enraged mood to bolster his physical strength. All anger affects the
body to some extent, yet to fully harvest that advantage in combat and
not waste it by concentrating on the fear for your own life is a skill
of its own. The higher you are skilled in this particular lesson of
of the barbarian art, the more strength you will gain by berserking.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Randomize preference.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int.
For a Spell weaver, this skill is usually the first cross-over
from sheer physical manipulation of the space around him to
actually mastering the arts of creating destruction at will.
Manipulation of the chosen target's very own body by turning
needed saps and blood in to streams of acid and death is an
impressive feat, even if Random. at first.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Ranged tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type:     special.

Fighting with a shield and a polearm combination is demanding activity due to
the fact that the handling of a long weapon is not easy when your other hand
is tied to a shield and you have to execute the attacks with one hand. Even
a fool can charge into a combat with an armament like this but it is more than
likely that the fool will meet his maker rather swiftly, without the knowledge
of what to do with his weapon. The knowledge in this skill helps the warrior
to use his shield and polearm more efficiently. The warrior will learn how and
where to strike and how to maintain his alertness level through the battle.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Recitation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int and cha.
Through skillful use of this ability, a bard can turn a boring,
run of the mill song into an exciting tale enjoyable for all
who watch and listen. Training this skill also allows the bard
to compose and create more songs and add a bit more variance to
his or her performances.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rectitude.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill reduces the randomness of the damage caused
by Inquisitor spells.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Remove elements.
Usage duration: 15.
Mental Cost: 100 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
When a monk successfully summons the nearby elemental energies and focuses
them into his knuckles, he retains some small amount of control over these
forces. For this reason, it is a simpler task for the monk to dispel the
elements surrounding his knuckles than it is to summon them in the first
place, taking far less mental energy. Since the monks are taught from an
early age that these forces are beneficial, and in fact almost necessary,
this skill is most often used so that the monk can call a different
element into his knuckles.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rescue.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This rather delicate technique is used for fighters with long experience
in fighting together as a group. Before entering a potentially dangerous
fight the leader and the potential rescuer agree on the level of damage
the leader will sustain before the rescuer steps to the front. Then as
the field of battle is reached the change of the person taking the
hits will automatically take place if the need occurs. A pact of rescuing,
once made, lasts until the warparty ends, or the rescuing takes place.
Usage: rescuer: use rescue at <leader>, leader: set wimpy to desired amnt.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Retort.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Along with other very offensive manouvers generated a long time ago,
this technique was also discovered. A cunning warrior, in a combat
trance, can use momentum of the opponents foolish hit by avoiding it
and turning that into a revengeful blow. Not full strength of the
opponents hit have been learned to be used but still considerable
amount of that strength is used.
Like mentioned above, amounts of suffering enemy will take from these
moves are totally dependant from strength of the enemys hit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Righteousness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill allows an Inquisitor to draw strength from his
conviction that Evil must be destroyed at all costs.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Riposte.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Riposting means performing an immediate counter-attack after a successful
parry. The amount of parried hits depends on your current defence factor
which is modified by many things, such as weight and skill percents.
You are able to riposte as many hits as you manage to parry, and
since some creatures can hit you quite often this can add to a great
amount of damage over time. Due to the quickness of the ripostes the
actual damage of one hit is quite low, although it can be augmented
with the skill Enhanced riposte.

Help on skill: Saturn lore.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill a measure of a Druids ability to take advantage of
the atronomical conjunctions of the planet Saturn.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Scattershot.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent and dexterity.
The Magus Artiste are known first and foremost for their incredible
accuracy and agility with projectile spells. But anyone who is expecting
an Artiste to always take their time and carefully aim each shot, is likely
to be unpleasantly surprised. When forgoing most of the time-consuming aiming
an Artiste is able to focus all their considerable talents into conjuring the
magics as quickly as possible, thus creating an overwhelming barrage of
projectiles. Needless to say, the accuracy of each shot is greatly reduced.
The energy of the projectiles is also lessened as the Artiste does not spend
as much time channeling the magic.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Sense weakness.

Skill type: automagic
With this skill Sorcerers can sense
the weaknesses of their targets and
focus their death wish at it.
It is automatically in use.

Help on skill: Sensory overload
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): int
Spell weavers properly trained in this technique will
occasionally succeed in augmenting the audio-visual part of
their binded magics to such proportions that it will momentarily
distract their enemy as their senses are overwhelmed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shield fighting.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill allows a Paladin to use his shield effectively
in combat. It is automatically in effect, but you must
log out and back in after first training it in order for
it to take effect.
Note: At higher levels of mastery, this skill can
momentarily stun an opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shielding control.

Help on skill: Shielding efficiency.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
Shielding efficiency is an invaluable sum of the tricks
of trade of the past Spell weaver generations, saving the little
ways used to make shielding somewhat easier for the caster.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shielding of death.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
Protective spells are fundamentally slightly incompatible with the traditional
mindset of necromancers. Because of this difference, it requires somewhat
additional effort for necromancers to be able to protect their minions
effectively. This skill represents deeper understanding and training in the
ways of protection for the uses of necromancy.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Skill that saves sp.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill reduces the spell point loss
on spell failure. The amount you save is

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Slash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
This skill allows you to slash your enemy with your sword. Knowledge
in the skills strike and bladed fury will increase the damage.
You must be wielding a sword to use this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Smash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
With this powerful skill a cleric may bludgeon a hated enemy to
death with several powerful blows from either a bludgeoning
weapon or a staff. The damage performed depends on the cleric's
strength and weapon power. Enraged priests are known to do
a bit more damage with this skill as well. The true power of
smash, however, lies in the priest's ability to deal multiple
attacks, causing much more damage than normal. These attacks
have been known to rarely interrupt the target's concentration
or even stun them completely. The number of extra attacks is
related to the priest's wisdom, weapon skills and the amount
of holy might they can channel, while to the damage of each
extra attack directly relates to the priest's faith.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spacial manipulation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill helps you create spells dealing with spacial
manipulations. The higher this skill is trained the more effective
these types of spells will be.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Specify part.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and undead surgery.
With this skill a necromancer can mold the unspecialized chunk of flesh
created with the 'prepare corpse'-skill to actually make a bodypart suitable
for use in the creation of advanced undead, such as the Frankenstein.
The effectiveness of this skill is dependent on the knowledge of this skill
and the skill 'undead surgery'.
Usage: use specify part at <hand/head/leg/torso>
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spinning patterns.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
This rather odd technique is seldom used in actual combat, but due
to its efficiency in physically straining its user, this technique
is still taught to the initiates of the guild. The principle of
the technique is to accelerate the movement of the bludgeons as
quickly and strongly as possible, ignoring the strain it causes
to the user. The fatigue created in the act of whirling is the
very reason the guild has abandoned it as a useful technique
for gathering momentum.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spiritism.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
The act of channelling energies through a spirit is far from simple,
and this skill is vital for maximal efficiency when transferring mental
energy to a called spirit. This skill also affects the efficiency of the
actual blast of negative energy from the spirit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spiritual link.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
Called spirits are almost incomprehensible creatures even for necromancers,
who are accustomed to dealing with beings originated from the negative energy
plane. Therefore a necromancer will benefit greatly from being more attuned to
the negative energy plane and gains the ability to transmit commands much
faster over the spiritual link to his called spirit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Split corpse.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Sometimes it is necessary for a necromancer to split a large corpse that
contains much power into two smaller ones, and this skill will allow it.
This messy and gory act, is actually a bit more complicated than just sawing
a corpse into pieces, as the power it contains has to be carefully guarded to
prevent it from escaping. The exact weight ratio of the produced remains
depends highly on the user's knowledge of this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spot weakness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Knowledge in this skill allows you to see an opening in the defence of
your enemy when using the skill Slash, Whirlwind slash and Hurl axes,

Skill type: neutral.
This skill produces a summary of the number and strength
conjunctions that will occur during the next 24 mud hours.
It doesn't produce details, only a summary.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Strike.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, weapon stats and skill knowledge.
Before a fighter is able to learn the finer points of techniques used in
various Offensive. maneuvers, it is crucial to learn to pack some force
behind the attacks. Striking is the most basic way of assaulting a target
with a melee-weapon. Since striking is a relatively simple way of attacking
an enemy, it can be easily misjudged as inefficient. This is partially
true, the finer techniques make better use of the special. properties of
their own specific weapon types, but they are also limited to those types
of weapons only. Striking works well in conjunction with any weapon type.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Strike mighty blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Named by the previous groups of initiate maulers, this skill orginates from
the vigorous exercises performed in order to augment the momentary strength
of a soldier. The idea of these exercises is to strengthen the fighter so
that he may, when needed to, gather all his strength behind one single maul.
This is a rather desperate tactic, since such a blow usually uses up the
fighter's reserves of power and there is a risk of the maul getting stuck.
Most maulers choose to use it as a last minute option to end a prolonged
fight with one mighty blow from a warhammer.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Stun.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
Any enemy a warrior might encounter, no matter how highly skilled, will
occasionally make mistakes in their defense, as will the warrior.
It is often said that the victor of the battle is the one who took
the most advantage from the other's errors. Critical and stunning
blows appear during these moments of the opponent's error, and
can easily tip the scale for the stunner's benefit. Stunned
enemies can not fight, flee, or avoid hits. Knowledge in
this skill increases the chance of stunning and the
duration of a successful stun.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Stunning blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int.
This skill will allow the caster a small chance to

Help on skill: Switch weapon.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: special.
This skill is used by rangers to quickly switch a wielded weapon
to a weapon in the combat weapon belt. It is a bit harder but not
impossible while fighting.
Syntax: use 'switch weapon' <weapon 1> <weapon2>
or use 'switch weapon' <weapon 1> to <weapon2>
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: System shock.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore the pain and damage he suffers
due to his enraged mood, but this advantage is only temporary.
Should the fighter remain alive long enough, the rage will
wear off and the pain will be felt. Highly experienced fighters
are able to ignore amounts of damage sufficient to instantly kill
a lesser person, and therefore it is vital to be able to deal with
the shock that follows calming down. The fighters skilled in system
shock will suffer a smaller portion of the damage ignored, and if
lucky, they can sometimes survive even if the damage felt exceeds
their current stamina.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tameshivar.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Taunt.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: combat.
A skilled bard always keeps a repitoire of insults and abuse
handy, learned from her time travelling the world.  A bard
can use these insults to enrage an enemy, causing them to
loose much in the way of defense power, but angering them
enough that they deal a great deal more damage in combat.
The taunt will last until the monster or bard are dead,
or the bard leaves the room.

Help on skill:     Throw
Usage duration:    1 round
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength and dexterity

Mastery in the art of throwing the deadly battlestars called shuriken is an
essential part of the Way of the Samurai. The samurai warglove Tebukuro-Ken
is used to handle the shurikens, which are often treated with dangerous
substances to inflict greater damage. Whilst the Way of the Samurai is one
that is difficult to fathom and great dexterity, skill and mastery is
required, it is a powerful path. Shurikens are very quick to throw and often
inflict critical damage at the hands of a true master.

The spirit of the blade flows through all aspects of the Samurai Arts. When
the katana is blessed with certain enchantments, its essence resonates with
the battlestars in flight. Some enchantments weaken the enemy's resolve with
each strike, while others open wounds that magnify the devastation of
subsequent throws. A true samurai understands that blade and shuriken are
one, unified through the Spirit World of Shinzui Yochi.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Throw sand.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Throwing sand in the eyes of your opponent is one of the less fair ways
to fight your duels, but in common warfare anything that keeps your
head on your shoulders goes. A successful throw can blind the
opponent and therefore allow the fighter to make a strategic
withdrawal if it's judged to be needed. The sand suitable for this
type of an attack can only be found outdoors.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tinning.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill supplies the knowledge required for the proper use of the
tinning kit. It takes some doing to learn to use the kit properly,
without this skill you would probably just make a mess of the ingredients.
To tin the dead body of a creature you consider edible you need this skill
and a functional tinning kit. The Tinker of Zombiecity is renowned for his
ability to construct the most reliable of tinning kits in all the realm.

Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: neutral.
File is broken.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tormentation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
The trainers of the Fighters' Guild have taken the habbit of denying the
existance of this entire technique due to its unpopular affects to the
'honor' of warfare. It is well known within the ranks of the mauler that
this technique is taught regardless due to its efficiency when used properly.
The name 'Tormentation' describes the purpose of this technique rather
well, the main purpose of the technique is to inflict pain upon an opponent,
making it hard for him to concentrate on anything except the pain.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Toss.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
A juggling skill that allows the bard to throw one of the
items she is juggling at her enemy.  The damage done by

Help on skill: Treecutting.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Some rangers have honed their skills in treecutting to such extent that
they are able to use an axe to make a very fast horizontal sweep targeted
at the opponenents legs as if cutting down a tree. This skill works better
at large opponents and you have to use an axe.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: True harmony.
Usage duration: automatic.

Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill is checked every time you cast a spell requiring harmony.
It increases the duration of the spell.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tumble.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Of the attack spells currently known to the spellcasting guilds of the realm,
a great number are released from the caster's body and travel in a physical path
towards the intended victim. When this is true, and depending upon the spell,
it may be possible for someone to tumble and avoid the spell entirely. This of
course requires extensive training, and even then is a risky thing to rely on,
since these spells are designed to hit the target, not to be avoided.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Undead surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and unholy ceremony and size of corpse.
Undead beings, owing to the fact that they are actually dead, do not
regenerate and heal like living beings do. Because of this drawback,
necromancers are forced to resort to other means to keep their minions
in good enough shape to fight. Because magical healing is rather inefficient
and is not really an area where necromancers are very proficient, a more
mundane, but very efficient method of healing has been devised.
This gruesome and disgusting technique is used to sew a damaged undead back
to working shape by using parts from another corpse. However, it is not
possible to repair all of the damage the undead has sustained with this skill.
The size of the used corpse also affects the maximum possible healing done
with this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Unholy ceremony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
When dealing with advanced concepts of necromancy, such as spiritism and
other unholy rituals, it is extremely important to know how the perform the
ceremonies correctly. Good knowledge of this skill symbolizes greater
understanding of such gruesome rituals and allows better efficiency and
higher power to be attained.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Unholy surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
The art of necromancy is age-old, and has been practised by numerous different
necromancers during the course of history. All that time has certainly not
been wasted, and necromancy is undergoing a strong change at this very moment.
Until recently, necromantic rituals have traditionally been very magical in
their nature. Most commonly, animation of dead corpses with negative energy
channeled directly from its native plane. The newest and most advanced addition
is the so-called scientific necromancy, which aims to produce undead creatures
in a very different manner, with little or no magic involved at all.
This particular skill is used to connect the specially crafted bodyparts of an

Help on skill:     Volo
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): dexterity, strength, weapon familiarity, pon deila, skill
                   knowledge and magus

Volo is the elven word for Speed. The quick, less powerful staff
fighting technique is understood through this word. Knowledge in
Volo is applied two-fold. Primarily, the Volo will make the melee
attacks of its user more powerful. The steady barrage of strikes is
meant to distract the target, and open up its defense for a larger
blow.  The power of these attacks lies in the physical fighting ability
of its user, as well as knowledge in Volo.

Battle-hardened Elves have recently looked to the Volo for a secondary
purpose -- rapidly converting their reservoirs of constitution into
split-second martial strikes, softening the bodies of their opponents.

Like with any other aspect of the art of staff fighting, the magical aura of
life the elvenkind refer only to as 'Magus', should it be powerful enough,
extends and enhances its user greatly beyond his typical physical fighting
ability. Even a seemingly weak practioner of Loc Ecsuram is to be feared,
should he prove strong in his devotion to this force.

By investing numerous human lifetimes becoming one with their Loc, the
Elf is better able to realize the Volo.

Help on skill:     Wall of steel.
Usage duration:    random.
Skill type:        defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, masteries and dex.

This skill teaches the warrior a way to use his shield on a skill level from
which untrained people can only dream of. He will be taught how to calculate
the landing areas of melee and missile attacks, and how to block them without
an extra effort, all the way to the point where performing a block turns into
almost instinctual activity. After the training the shield will no longer be
a part of his armament but a part of him, a proverbial steel wall that stands
between him and his foes. It is said that true masters of this skill have
dared to challenge even sorcerers and other magicians of great power, walking
out from those duels with only few fried hair. The success ratio of this skill
depends on user's knowledge of this skill, his shield related fighter
masteries and dexterity.

Help on skill: Whirling maces.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
The deadliest of bludgeons cause devastating damage because of several key
factors. Magical properties, crudely placed spikes and raw force all help, but
the most important factor is the momentum of the maul. The greater velocity
the greater damage upon impact. This technique instructs its master to whirl
his maces in the fashion that besides dealing blows, the maces also pick up
speed. The whirling effect however makes this technique quite inaccurate, and
damage caused by it is often Random. and badly placed even if impressive.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Whirlwind attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Whirlwind attacks are hit combinations that base themselves upon using
the momentum of the wielded weapon. A standard Offensive. from a fighter
begins with an attack, instantly followed by a doublehit to approximately
the same area, and then the whirlwind attack is executed. This happens
by applying leverage to the weapon, swinging it quickly around, and
striking yet another hit. There are as many techniques to perform
a whirlwind attack as there are warriors proficient in it, but the
quick pull after a hit is the key element. Whirlwind attack can be
successful only after a doublehit, and it is possible to execute it
with either or both hands. Therefore a skilled warrior can hit up to
six times, although some of the Warlords have been seen performing
combinations with even more attacks in them.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Whirlwind slash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
The skilled fighters and rangers who have chosen blades as their preferred
weapon sometimes execute whirling slashes that wound multiple opponents at
once. The principle of this weapon technique is to engage the intended
targets in melee-combat, drawing them close enough for the blade's reach,
and then launching a series of slashes and cuts at the entire mass of
enemies. Although any given one of the wounds inflicted will most likely
prove far inferior to those a blademaster can inflict with a targeted slash,
with weak or injured enemies this display of swordmanship can take out
several foes at once. This technique is popularly used for executing the
hostile, yet inadept, peasants.

Help on skill:     Wild strike
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           high
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, intelligence, attack, weapon skill, anatomy and spot weakness

The typical spellblade is far from a martial master, relying on magic to gain the upper hand. As such, their training in melee techniques leave much room for improvement. This one in particular is a most basic attack, executed quickly
and usually with a distinct lack of skill. But it is often heavily augmented with magic, making the attack something to be wary of.
This attack can only be executed with daggers, swords, polearms, or bladed or piercing ancients.

Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automagic.
Necromancers are usually physically weak beings, and depend on their mindless

Help on skill: Wondrous legerdemain.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity, charisma and intelligence.
One might be impressed to see a bard juggling several wickedly sharp axes,
but when one witnesses a Magus Artiste doing the same with firebolts one has
a reason to be truly awed.
While the actual juggling of projectiles is beyond most, each Artiste with
at least some training in the "wondrous legerdemain" is able to counter
hostile projectile magics to a great degree. This talent employs almost
dance-like routines not only for avoiding the projectile but gaining limited
control over it. By expending a slight amount of magical energy, the Artiste
can alter the course of the bolt and potentially launch it back towards its
original caster. As the skill of the Artiste increases they are actually
able to suspend the bolt almost indefinitely by keeping the projectile in
motion but constantly influencing its course, making it appears as if they
were juggling with it. These projectiles can then be thrown at will at a
target.
Being trained in the arts of acrobacy and traditional juggling have been
found to be of benefit.

Affecting stat(s): skillpercent

By using this 'skill that removes user from location of origin and places user in
location of destination', the user will be removed from the location of his, her
or its origin, i.e. the location in which the user used the skill, and, after being
removed from this location, will be placed in a second location which, because it
is the location that results from the successful use of this skill, is known as the
location of destination, and is usually a different place than the place where the
skill was used, a/k/a the 'location of origin,' ipso facto.

Help on skill:     Meteoric charge
Usage duration:    2 rounds
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): constitution and wisdom

Akin to the brutal technique used by the Fighter's guild, the Golden Art
known as Meteoric Charge is a combat initiator. Once an enemy has been
sighted, it is crucial to keep the initiative if possible. Starting
the combat by launching themselves forward with using stored kinetic energy
from deep within the cosmos, a member of the Golden Company is able to close
the distance with their adversary, allowing them to relentlessly pursue
their quarry all the while putting themselves in between the foe and
any possible allies.

A sword and a shield must be equipped to use this skill.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Golden spear
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           very low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): wisdom, charisma and constitution

The Golden Company has vast knowledge about protective invocations that
rival similar magics used by the guild of Abjurers. What the Company does
not possess however, are abilities that would create persistent and potent
vulnerabilities in their targets. In trying to solve this conundrum, one
of the most inventive invoker found out that should the target be holding
a golden conduit, the transference of stellar damage into its frame would
be that much easier. It is, however, often folly to try and ask possible
foes if they would be so kind as to hold on to a conduit while doing
combat.

And so, the members of the Golden Company fashioned a skill that allows
an invoker to quickly fashion a conductive golden spear out of coins
they carry and hurl that projectile against the target, hoping that
it embeds itself deep enough so that it can do its job regardless of how
the target might feel about it. As the conjuration is very volatile, and
often great energies are transfered through the conduit, it will only
last a short while until it disappears altogether.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Golden dome
Usage duration: 2 rounds
Skill type:     neutral

To facilitate their stargazing, the invokers of the Golden Company
have invented a way for them to conjure a representation of the very
golden dome they use as their guildhall. Through some aptitude with
illusionary arts, an invoker is able to create a facsimile of the
hallucinatory forest of the Druids. While this conjuration is not
nearly as potent and somewhat more difficult to create, it does have
the same benefits and drawbacks as the very spell that inspired it.

Gold functions as the physical material required for this conjuration.

Help on skill:     Unyielding will
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, guild levels in paladin, healer and ranger or
                   druid

Each of the founding guilds that created the Golden Company have their own
view on how the astral order should best be kept. The guilds are not in
competition, but seek to complement one another to create the perfect
specimen.

The guild of the Paladins uses their religious fervor to fuel the defensive
capabilities of the Golden Arts.

The guild of the Healers use their restorative energies to heal and to
preserve all living things so that no spark of life should ever go to waste.

The guild of the Druids provide the Golden Company with mastery over the
elements, most importantly that of the fire found within the stars.

The guild of the Rangers possesses invaluable information about the
coexistence between all manner of living creatures.

Each of the individual guilds brings together their expertise to fuel
the Golden Arts in different ways, known only to the invokers of the
Golden Company.

Help on skill:     The art of war
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent

The Golden Company consists mostly of scholarly types, ponderous and 
full of wisdom. Their interests lie not on the tactical scale of 
battles, but on the grand scheme of warfare. Any actions they take 
works towards a greater goal; individual battles may go one way or 
another, but the end result is what is important. That is not to say, 
however, that an individual battle should be lost. Through countless 
hours of training the invokers of the Golden Company have found a way 
to strike with deadly ferocity when such a need arises. Fueled by 
their indomitable will, the invokers can, when pushed, best even the 
mightiest of warriors in single combat, using their wisdom and 
knowledge to strike upon a weakness possibly even unknown to the 
adversary themself.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Sundering star
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           very low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): constitution, strength, wisdom, weapon skill, weapon stats,
                   active defensive auras, shield fighting, shield techniques,
                   bash, parry, aegis, piety, righteousness and unyielding will

Sometimes, in order to attack, one must first defend until sufficient
information about the enemy can be gathered. Haphazardly throwing
ones offensive abilities at a target is thus pointless, and something
more calculated is required to buy sufficient time in the heat of the
battle. In order to increase their own survivability and to reduce
the combat effectiveness of an adversary, the invokers of the Golden
Company have devised the technique of the Sundering Star. By enchanting
their shield with the sidereal energies and striking the enemy with it
can they do just that.
The efficiency of this skill is largely determined by the amount of
defensive Golden Arts the invoker is currently performing as well as
the users proximity to the target.
If used with an armament of sufficient elemental potency, this ability
often causes the target to become susceptible to followup attacks.
This attack can only be executed while wielding a sword and a shield.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Obliteration
Usage duration:    random

                   active offensive auras, ogham rhetoric, true transfer damage
                   and sword techniques

The majority of the combat prowess an invoker of the Golden Company
possesses is sourced from their Golden Arts. As the Arts are mostly
tied to the regenerative mental powers of the user, this leaves
their physical stamina relatively untouched. To best utilize all
the power available, the Golden Company has created a technique
known as obliteration. Through clever use of dormant innate powers
a strong invoker is able to become stronger still, fueling the
impact of the skill with their active offensive Arts. This attack
works best from a flanking position.
If used with an armament of sufficient elemental potency, this ability
often causes the target to become susceptible to followup attacks.
This attack can only be executed while wielding a sword and a shield.

Help on skill:  Flow of life
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

A good healer knows exactly how to manipulate body energies and raw magic
into tangiable, life giving form, but the best healers know how to mold
this ever-present flow of life into form with such speed that can only come
from knowing the fabric of the heart of the world itself. Diligent study of
the natural flow of life around us grants speed to the caster of true heal
spells which, while difficult to truly master, can sometimes provide that
added deftness to a heal which could make all the difference between life
and death.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Enhanced evasion
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

The nimbleness of the goblins is unlike the graceful agility of the elves,
or the predatory litheness of the catfolk. It is best described as a
talent for weaseling in and out of things, a physical and metaphysical
slipperiness that makes goblins hard to pin down in all of their affairs.
Enhanced evasion harnesses this instinctive cunning into a more refined
set of techniques designed for combat. Training in enhanced evasion
significantly improves the rate at which goblins dodge, reduces penalties
caused by carried weight, and reduces fatigue caused by dodging.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Hoodwink
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

Goblins are among the world's best hagglers, but they have no rivals in the
world of confidence tricks -- which they view almost as a form of sport.
The best tricks prey on the avarice of others, by making the mark think he
is taking advantage of the confidence artist, when the reverse is actually
true. Goblins have a vast repertoire of such techniques, which they deploy
almost without thinking, turning every interaction into a game of
oneupsmanship and tactical advantage. 'Hoodwinking' is what goblins call
this, and it comes in especially handy during business dealings.
A goblin practiced in this technique will occasionally be able to sell
items at inflated prices far exceeding their ordinary sale value,
through the use of confidence tricks and other ruses.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Purse-cutting
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

The instinctive opportunism of goblins is so strong, so pervasive, that
it could be called compulsive. Just as water seeks out cracks in stone,
the goblin mind constantly searches for openings that it can exploit,
at every moment, in every interaction.

The thrusting maneuver taught by the thieves' guild brings the user within
close range of the victim, where he must rely on deft footwork and
misdirection to land a quick strike on his mark. Goblins regard all
this work as a missed opportunity - to come so close to the valuables of
one's target, only to leave them intact and in place. The technique
of purse-cutting allows a skilled goblin to make more out of thrusting,
with blows aimed to cut purse strings and pilfer extra coins from the victim.
These thrusts may also expose weaknesses that increase damage done by later
attacks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Facilitating payments
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

The couther races of the world cherish such virtues as love, valor,
honesty, loyalty and sacrifice. But the shrewd and practical goblins
have little use for these frail sentiments. They know but one thing
makes the world go 'round: money. Lots and lots of money.

It is customary in certain offices and certain quarters to furnish
government officials with a token of one's appreciation. Such 'tips'
may accelerate the performance of official functions, or encourage
decisions in the donor's favor. Goblins understand that other races
frown upon such practices, but they consider this self-righteousness
to be hopelessly naive. Money turns the wheels of commerce, and
facilitating payments are nothing more than a necessary cost of doing
business. These bribes are especially effective at influencing the
outcomes of games of chance, such as lotteries, that leave room for
human influence and intervention.  This skill teaches accepted methods
of government bribery, and proficiency reduces the amounts necessary
to bribe various officials.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Metachrosis
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

Of all the greenskin races, goblins best live up to the name. All but
a rare few have green-pigmented features, and this telltale skin,
together with their short stature and long, crooked noses, are
considered by many to be the race's distinguishing features.

Little do these outsiders know, for the pigment in a goblin's skin
is no ordinary substance. It changes color, often quite dramatically,
in response to danger, injury, and other external stimuli. Disciplined
goblins can learn to exert control over these involuntary responses,
harnessing their chameleonic tendencies to blend at will into their
surroundings. Training in this skill, called metachrosis, allows
goblins to hide more quickly and expertly, and to stay hidden when moving.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Sabotage
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

Goblins have survived for centuries in the company of savages, shunned
by the finer races, dwarved and bullied by their more feral kin.
Cunning, subterfuge and sabotage have been the key to the goblins'
survival. What they lack in might and mystical ability, they make up for
with amorality and a shrewd lack of scruples. In warfare, a goblin's goal
is simple: survive by any means necessary. Goblins do not believe in such
a thing as 'honorable' combat. Violence is unavoidably vicious, and
those who aim to make it noble are either deluded or lying. Only fools
would handicap themselves by using less than all available tools at their
disposal. Goblins do not suffer fools gladly.

It should come as no surprise, given their philosophical leanings, that
goblins have become masters of poisons and other tools of 'foul' play. These
methods have been the key to the species' survival from its beginnings.
The art of sabotage improves the effectiveness of poisons mixed by a goblin,
and enhances his natural affinity with poisons, increasing damage done by
all poison attacks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Cabinetry
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

Goblins are crafty, but they are not apt to be craftsmen, preferring to
leave nuanced artisanry to the finer races. Even so, goblins have an
abiding interest in cabinets, drawers, trunks, chests, and just about
any object that can be used to store valuables -- from a technical, if
not an aesthetic standpoint. The study of cabinetry familiarizes goblins
with the carpentry methods involved in making containers, which comes in
handy when inspecting the panels and joints of chests for hidden
compartments. Cabinetry experts may thus discover special treasure within
ordinary, everyday containers.

Help on skill:     Quantum sleight
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): charisma and dexterity

Goblins are not wordsmiths, but they have a penchant for borrowing memorable,
usually cryptic, turns of phrase. One of their favorite proverbs holds: 'The
distinction between the past, present and future is a stubbornly
persistent illusion.' Whatever this once meant, goblins interpret it
in only one way: time, if illusory, is ripe for exploitation.

And so came about the ruse of the 'quantum sleight,' a peculiar form of illusion
that tricks the victim into believing he is frozen in time. Time, of course,
does not actually stop -- the illusionist and third parties may continue to
move and act normally while the illusion is in effect. The victim, however,
fixates on a specific moment in the past and stays in that moment until the
sleight wears off.  The victim will be unable to move or attack, and any skills
or spells he was using will be paused, then resumed when the illusion subsides.

This trick can only be performed with some kind of magical timepiece, which
serves to focus the user's temporal magic, and to hypnotize the victim, making
him susceptible to suggestion. The skill places some strain on the timepiece,
which will need time to recover before this skill can be used again. The
quality of the illusion depends on the quality of the timepiece, along with
the user's charisma, mastery of illusion, and training in both quantum sleight
and spacial manipulation. Dexterity speeds up the performance.

Help on skill:  Creative accounting
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

Banking regulations prevent certain entrepreneurial spirits from storing
their ill-gotten gains in traditional financial institutions. But a shrewd
businessperson can overcome this limitation by concealing the source of
money through clever bookkeeping. Practitioners of creative accounting
learn to prepare financial statements so dense, circular and unintelligible
that even banking professionals will be deceived. Any amount of training
in this skill will permit the user to store money in the banks of the land,
albeit at an increased tax rate. Additional training reduces the rate of
taxation, while high levels of proficiency enable the user to evade taxes
almost completely.

With this skill the user can strangle his victim. While strangling, user
can't do any other combat actions, and while being strangled, the victim
can't escape.
The stronger and more agile the opponent is, the more difficult it is to
strangle it.

Help on skill:  Ancestral leap
Usage duration: random
Fatigue:        low
Skill type:     misc

An ancient primal technique passed down through countless generations
of barbarian warriors. By calling upon ancestral spirits and tapping
into the primal bonds that connect all barbarians to sacred places,
a warrior can leap through the spirit realm itself, emerging at
locations infused with tribal power.

The technique requires immense physical and spiritual energy, as the
warrior must forcefully tear open a path through the veil between
worlds. Only places deeply bound to barbarian heritage - guild halls,
ancient battlegrounds, ritual sites - resonate strongly enough to
serve as anchors for this journey.

The spirits of the wild do not merely offer strength. They offer insight,
clarity, wisdom that predates civilization itself. Through your deep
connection with the spiritual realm, you can channel collective wisdom of
nature, sharing this clarity with your allies.

When you open yourself as a conduit, spiritual energy flows through you
and into your companions. Their minds become sharper, their senses keener,
their abilities enhanced by this touch of the otherworld. They see threats
more clearly and perceive weaknesses that would otherwise remain hidden.
This is the gift of the Savage to their party: not just physical might,
but the wisdom of ancients and the clarity of spirit.

Ancient tribes knew what civilized warriors have forgotten: symbols have
power. Not through magic, but through connection. When you paint mystical
patterns across your face and body using sacred pigments, you connect to
primal forces: the fury of predators, the endurance of stone, the cunning
of the hunter. As paint dries upon your skin, you feel the power of your
ancestors flowing through sacred symbols.

The patterns are many, each channeling different aspects of the primal
world. Some enhance physical might or resilience, others sharpen combat
instincts or bring fortune in battle. The choice of pattern reflects your
intent: what you seek to embody in coming conflict.

Trained soldiers retreat when wounded. Tactical withdrawal, they call it.
Strategic repositioning. The berserker knows what they refuse to admit:
these are just polite words for cowardice.

You do not retreat. You do not reposition. You advance. Always forward,
never back. Arrows find you? Advance. Spells strike you? Advance. The
enemy lands a perfect blow that should drop you? Absorb it and advance.
Pain is temporary. Momentum is survival. To stop moving forward is to
acknowledge your enemy as a threat worth avoiding.

Every impact you take feeds the rage. Every wound makes you more dangerous,
not less. Where civilized warriors see injury and think of healing, you see
fuel for the fury that propels you into striking range. By the time you
reach your enemy, you have transformed their attacks into your own power.

The berserker does not stop. The berserker arrives.

Usage duration:    automatic

Affecting stat(s): constitution, stamina and skill percent

The barbarian way is one of endless endurance. Where civilized warriors
tire and falter, the barbarian presses on. Where others must rest and
recover, the hunt continues. This is not mere stubbornness - it is a
fundamental truth of existence. Pain is temporary, exhaustion is weakness,
and surrender is death.

The body forged through countless trials becomes an instrument of relentless
warfare. Recovery from exertion comes faster than normal warriors, and
actions frequently cost less stamina. The longer a battle extends, the more
the advantage grows as weaker opponents exhaust themselves while the
barbarian presses on with unyielding determination.

Civilized warriors respect distance. They maneuver cautiously, close gaps
with measured steps, maintain defensive posture while advancing. This is
what cowards call tactics. The savage knows better: distance is an illusion
that exists only for those too weak to shatter it.

Fury demands blood now. Not after careful positioning. Not when the tactical
situation favors it. Now. You explode forward with the momentum of an
avalanche, closing impossible gaps in heartbeats, weapon raised, the roar
of your charge announcing what your enemy already knows: running is futile.

The impact when you arrive is not combat, it is collision. They prepared
to fight, but you don't fight at distance. You arrive like a force of
nature and obliterate whatever stands before you. By the time they register
you've moved, your weapon has already found them.

Distance is a courtesy. The savage extends no courtesies.

The blood calls. Not metaphorically, not symbolically - your own blood,
ancient and knowing, demands to be spilled. The civilized recoil from
self-inflicted wounds, calling it madness. They understand nothing of
power written in scars, of strength purchased with sacrifice.

You tear open old wounds or carve new ones, letting your blood flow free.
As crimson streams down your body, something awakens - the blood of every
ancestor who fell in battle, every warrior whose line led to you. Their
fury mingles with yours, their strength becomes yours. Pain becomes fuel.

When you charge, you are no longer alone. Unseen hands guide your weapon.
Ancient rage amplifies your fury. The blood-price paid transforms you into
something more than mortal, and when you crash into your enemy trailing
crimson, they face not just you, but the weight of every bloodline warrior
who demands vengeance through your hands.

Blood demands blood. The ancestors accept no other currency.

Usage duration:    automatic

Affecting stat(s): strength and skill percent

Civilized warriors falter when their strikes miss. They adjust, recalculate,
hesitate. The barbarian does not. Each dodge teaches. Each parry reveals.
Each tumbling escape maps the enemy's patterns. Failure is not setback - it
is reconnaissance written in the language of violence.

Where others see frustration in a blocked strike, the savage sees opening.
That sidestep showed weight distribution. That parry revealed reach and
reaction speed. That tumble displayed timing. The prey has shown its dance,
and predators learn fast.

The next strike comes differently - heavier, faster, from an unexpected
angle. Techniques that worked moments ago suddenly fail. The barbarian
adapts with brutal efficiency, overwhelming defensive patterns through raw
physical dominance and learned advantage.

Miss once, twice - it matters not. The barbarian will overpower.

There are moments when the fury burning in barbarian veins refuses to be
contained, even when the body is battered and stunned. Berserker rage does
not bow to pain or exhaustion - it feeds on them. When lesser warriors
would fall helpless, barbarian fury erupts in a defiant roar that shatters
whatever forces seek to bind.

This primal surge of adrenaline breaks the stunned free and momentarily
dulls pain, allowing the fight to continue when others would fall.

Combat instructors teach balance. Maintain your guard. Never overcommit.
Protect yourself while attacking. The barbarian rejects this philosophy
entirely. There are moments when caution is cowardice, when defense is
delay, when the only path forward is through absolute, reckless violence.

Throw aside every lesson about protection. Abandon guard. Overextend.
Commit everything, body, weapon, fury itself, into one devastating strike
delivered with such overwhelming force that the enemy's defense becomes
meaningless. Let them see the opening you create. Let them understand what's
coming. It changes nothing.

This is not technique or strategy. This is the moment when you decide that
killing your enemy matters more than your own safety, and you make that
decision with steel and fury. Either they fall or you do.

Civilized warriors fight to survive. The barbarian fights to kill.

Civilized armies march in silence, maintaining discipline and formation.
They believe noise weakens strategy. Fools. The primal tribes know what
those orderly ranks have forgotten: sound itself i s a weapon. Not words,
not commands - raw, inhuman, bone-shaking fury given voice.

Your roar is not merely loud. It carries physical force, reverberating
through enemy bodies like a shockwave. Ears ring. Vision blurs. The
confident warrior who stood ready a heartbeat ago now staggers, their
certainty shattered by the primal reminder that they are prey, and you
are predator.

Where the enemy hears terror, your allies hear something else: the call
to war. The sound that says the hunt has begun. Their own fury rises to
match yours.

The roar is older than language, more honest than steel.

Death comes for everyone. Most warriors accept this inevitability when
wounds become too grave, when blood loss becomes too severe. A Warbringer
knows better. Even when your body screams for mercy, when blood pools at
your feet, when enemies smell victory, you have one final refusal left.

Drawing upon reserves you did not know existed, fueled by pure stubborn
defiance, you plant your feet and declare: not yet. Not here. Not to you.
Your wounds seem to matter less. Your armor feels heavier on their weapons
than on your shoulders. Your body remembers how to mend itself even as you
fight. This is what separates the Warbringer from ordinary warriors.
Everyone can fight when fresh. You fight hardest when you should already
be dead.

Death teaches quickly. Survive enough battles and something primal awakens
within: not thought, not technique, but pure predatory awareness. The kind
of instinct that keeps apex predators alive in their brutal world.

Where trained warriors analyze and calculate, the barbarian simply knows.
The shift in air pressure before a blade falls. The tensing of muscle
before a spell unleashes. The body moves before the mind registers the
threat, erupting away from danger with the explosive violence of a cornered
beast.

Others call it luck. Those who possess it know better. This is what happens
when fury and survival instinct merge into something beyond mere skill. When
one has danced with death so often that its approach is recognized by scent
alone.

And when death's strike misses? That's when the predator strikes back.

The blood of ancient warriors flows in your veins. Their spirits walk beside
you, watching over their descendants with pride. Through deep communion with
these ancestral souls, you can call upon their wisdom and strength to guide
your hand in battle.

When you invoke this ancient rite, the spirits of your forebears manifest
around you - not as ghosts, but as echoes of will and power that merge with
your own. Their battle-hardened instincts sharpen your reflexes. Their
accumulated wisdom guides your strikes to vital points. Their enduring
strength fortifies your body.

This is the essence of the Savage path - you do not fight alone. You carry
the strength of generations, and when you call, they answer.

Through sacred ancestral rites, the barbarian performs a ritual send-off for
fallen enemies, honoring their warrior spirit and sending their soul to join
the ancestors. This act of respect for worthy foes draws upon ancient spirits
to bless the barbarian with renewed vitality, restoring both health and vigor
while gaining the favor of those who watch from beyond.

The ritual requires significant spiritual energy and can only be performed upon
the corpse of a slain enemy. The greater the fallen warrior, the more potent
the blessing received.

Swordmasters practice clean cuts. Precise. Elegant. Minimal damage for
maximum effect, they claim. The barbarian understands what they refuse to
see: elegance is weakness. Your enemy doesn't need a clean death. They
need to be ruined. To be bled out.

You don't simply cut. You rend. The initial strike is just the beginning.
As your weapon bites deep, you twist. Wrench. Turn a wound into catastrophe.
Muscle tears away from bone. Tendons snap like rotted rope. What was a
functional body becomes a ruin of separated parts still attached by stubborn
threads of tissue.

Where civilized fighters aim for quick kills, you aim for devastation. Your
enemy will not just fall, they will break. Not just die, they will be
torn apart. The difference between striking and rending is the difference
between injury and destruction.

What was whole becomes ruined. This is the barbarian way.

Reputation intimidates. Scars intimidate. But a true Warbringer projects
menace as something more tangible, more immediate. It radiates from your
scarred flesh, your unwavering stance, the cold certainty in your eyes that
says you have seen death a thousand times and sent it away disappointed.

When you consciously channel this aura, enemies hesitate. Their strikes
falter. They pull back at the last moment. They aim for less vital spots,
not from mercy, but from primal fear. The kind that makes prey reconsider
attacking a predator. This is not magic. This is pure, distilled menace
given form, making you a fortress that enemies batter themselves against
with decreasing conviction.

Battlefield chaos needs an anchor. Your allies need guidance, strength,
a rallying point for their courage. You provide this through the ancient
tradition of the war shout: a primal battle cry that resonates with power,
stirring the hearts of your companions and striking fear into enemies.

When you unleash your war cry, those who fight beside you feel renewed
vigor. Their strikes hit harder, their armor feels stronger, their resolve
hardens. This is battlefield leadership at its essence. Not commands, but
inspiration made manifest through raw vocal force. The act of rallying your
warriors also feeds your own fury, preparing you for carnage to come. This
is how the Warbringer leads: from the front, with strength that lifts all
who follow.

Trained fighters pace themselves. They calculate. They measure each strike,
conserving energy for prolonged combat. The barbarian does not.

There comes a moment when control becomes a luxury you cannot afford, when
the only path to victory is through overwhelming, relentless violence. Your
weapon becomes a blur. One strike flows into the next without pause, without
thought, without mercy. Again. Again. Again. A cascade of steel that gives
no quarter, no moment to recover, no breath to defend.

This is not fighting - this is drowning your enemy in brutality. They cannot
block all the strikes. Cannot dodge every blow. Cannot distinguish where one
attack ends and the next begins. By the time the storm passes, they stand
bleeding from wounds they never saw coming, their defense shattered by the
sheer impossible speed of savage fury.

Civilization teaches restraint. The frenzy teaches victory.
